The directory

	django_monetdb

and it's files should live at the same level as your Django
application directory.

For example, if your Django project is foo and your Django
application is bar, then you want this directory structure:

	foo/
	 | 
         +-- bar/
         |
         +-- django_monetdb/

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  n.b. django_monetdb, not monetdb-django

Create the database and user in monetdb, and run python
manage.py syncdb.  You can use the script ./regress/createdb.sh
to create a database in MonetDB.
